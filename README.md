OVERVIEW 

  This project focuses on creating a robust book recommender system by merging three tables, performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
  and implementing feature construction techniques. The goal is to enhance transparency and optimize recommendations for users.

STEPS TAKEN--
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Importing Data

Utilized pandas to import the necessary data for analysis.

2. Data Overview

Checked the shape of the data to understand its dimensions.
Examined the first few rows using head() to gain initial insights.

3. Data Information

Used info() to obtain a summary of the data types and missing values.

4. Handling Missing Values

Addressed missing values in the 'Year of Publication' column.
Removed categorical values impacting analysis.

5. Data Exploration

Explored unique values in relevant columns for a comprehensive understanding.

DATA CLEANING
   1. Column Removal

        Dropped unnecessary columns for simplicity and focus.
             'Image-URL-S'
             'Image-URL-M'
             'Image-URL-L'

  2. Table Merging

       Merged three tables to consolidate information and maintain transparency.

FEATURE CONSTRUCTION
  1. Book Author and Title
     Applied feature construction techniques to enhance the relevance of author and title information.

IMPUTATION
  1. Age Imputation
    Imputed missing values in the 'Age' column using both median and mean for a balanced approach.


CONCLUSION

   This project demonstrates a systematic approach to building a book recommender system, incorporating EDA, data cleaning, and feature construction. 
   The resulting system offers improved transparency and accuracy in book recommendations.
