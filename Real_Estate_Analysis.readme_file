OVERVIEW
 
  This project involves the analysis of real estate data, covering various aspects such as data exploration, visualization,
  data cleaning, outlier detection, and predictive modeling. The primary objective is to gain insights into the real estate dataset and develop a predictive model
  for the 'Sale Amount' using machine learning techniques.

Steps Taken 
DATA EXPLORATION AND VISUALIZATION 

1. Loading and Overview
   - Imported the dataset using pandas and inspected its shape and structure.
   - Displayed the first few rows and a random sample of the data for initial insights.

2. Summary Statistics and Info
   - Utilized info(), describe(), and isnull().sum() to understand data types, summary statistics, and identify missing values.

3. Visualization
   - Employed seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization, including count plots, histograms, and boxplots to explore features like 
'Property Type,' 'Residential Type,' 'Sale Amount,' 'Assessed Value,' and more.

DATA CLEANING

1. Handling Missing Values
   - Removed rows with missing or 'Nan' values in critical columns such as 'Address,' 'Assessed Value,' 'List Year,' 'Date Recorded,' 'Town,' and 'Sale Amount.'

2. Imputation
   - Imputed missing values in categorical columns ('Property Type' and 'Residential Type') with the mode.
  - Replaced zero values in 'Assessed Value' and 'Sale Amount' with the mean.

3. Encoding
   - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical columns for modeling purposes.

4. Outlier Detection and Treatment
   - Identified outliers using z-scores and created visualizations using boxplots.
   - Winsorized extreme values in 'Sale Amount,' 'Assessed Value,' and 'Sales Ratio.'
   - Applied log transformation and reciprocal transformation to handle skewness in numerical features.

PREDICTIVE MODELING

1. Data Splitting and Scaling
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Standardized the features using StandardScaler.

2. Lasso Regression Model
  - Developed a Lasso regression model to predict 'Sale Amount.'
  - Fine-tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
  - Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

3. Linear Regression Model
  - Built a Linear Regression model as a baseline for comparison.
  - Assessed the model's performance using MSE and R-squared.
